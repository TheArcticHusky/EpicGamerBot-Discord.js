# Certified Epic Gamer Discord Bot

This bot is written in javscript using Node.js and the Discord.js module.  I'm working on this primarily as a project to help me learn javscript, but it also serve some use to our Discord server, even if that is mostly just for screwing with each other.

If you want to see my current progress on the bot, feel free to check out my [Trello List](https://trello.com/b/Z3G2p1Gt).  It's coming, even if slowly.

## Documentation
The bot has a decent bit commands, the list of which is constantly growing as I have new ideas, so here is some documentation on how to use them:

#### Prefix: '?'
- Syntax: ?[command] [argument]

#### Help
Displays all command aliases and descriptions.

- Sytax: ?help [optional argument]

- Arguments: 
  - [empty]: Displays all commands available to members.
  - admin: Displays all commands available to admins.  (Requires admin permissions)
  - [Any Valid Command]: Displays specific information about the command entered.
  
This is only user-available command with significant functions, however, more are coming very soon.
